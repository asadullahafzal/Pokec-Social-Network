Pokec Social Network Analysis
Overview
This repository contains the project files for my Discrete Structures course, where I analyzed the Pokec social network dataset. The project demonstrates the application of various discrete mathematical concepts to real-world data.

Dataset
The Pokec social network dataset includes:

Profiles: Information about users in the network.
Relationships: Connections between users.
For more details on the dataset, refer to the https://snap.stanford.edu/data/soc-Pokec.html.

Objectives
Analyze the structure of the social network using discrete mathematics.
Apply concepts like graphs, sets, and relations to uncover insights.
Visualize and interpret network properties.
Methods and Concepts
The following discrete concepts were applied:

Graphs: Represented the social network as a graph where:
Users = Nodes
Relationships = Edges

Set Theory: 
Studied subsets of users based on attributes like age and location.

Relations: 
Examined properties like reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity in relationships.

Graph Metrics: 
Analyzed degree distributions, connected components, and shortest paths.

Algorithms: 
Used algorithms like BFS and DFS for traversal and analysis.

Results
Degree Distribution: 
Insights into user connectivity.

Community Detection: 
Identified tightly-knit user groups.

Transitivity Analysis: 
Explored the clustering coefficient of the network
